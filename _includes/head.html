          "Vocal Flair is a large vocabulary set with a main page that is primarily flat-but-dynamic core, and links to additional categorized support words. Vocal Flair has about 2,600 words but can easily grow, and contains pre-determined locations for personalized words and phrases. Emphasis is put on faster access to more-robust and more-common words, and a keyboard with built-in suggestions is also included, as well as alphabetized word lists, to increase flexibility.",
          "The included vocabulary is drawn from multiple sources, including Quick Core, PrAACCtical AAC, and various online word frequency lists, as noted on respective sub-boards.",
          "The top-level board is organized and color-coded around common sentence structure, and includes some dynamic buttons that can change based on prior buttons, but default to commonly-used words. Vocal Flair is designed to support auto-inflections to help speed up communication, and symbols can easily be disabled for a word-focused vocabulary.",
          "A collection of context-specific categories are included, and additional categories can easily be added or adjusted based on the needs of the individual communicator.",
          "Vocal Flair is built to be consistent for a developing communicator, while also being robust enough to grow with them grammatically, and to be straightforward enough for families and support teams to learn and implement in a variety of settings.",
