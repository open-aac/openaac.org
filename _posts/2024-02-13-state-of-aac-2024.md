<p>A lot can happen in a year! From the presentations to the app features to the latest updates... sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the things going on around AAC. That's why we're collecting and presenting an annual summary called the <b>State of AAC!</b></p>

<p>The <b>State of AAC</b> is a mix of looking backward and forward, reviewing what's happened, and trying to catch of glimpse of where things might be going. It's compiled from multiple sources, including participation from AAC users, families and specialists around the country and around the world.

<h2>Pop Culture</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRUk4aR3MEU">
<img src="/images/2024/bluey.png" class='pic left' style='width: 250px;' alt="clip from TV show Bluey" /></a>
<p>We should probably preface all of this by warning that just because something makes the year-in-AAC cut doesn't mean it's got any official sort of seal of approval, just that it counts as AAC representation. I mean, we do have our limits (you'll have to find the Matt Rife Marlena clip yourself, sorry), but our goal is to provide a broad view to help everyone see what they may have missed rather than to do too strict a curation. Although if you want to make sure and stay on the safe side, there's always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRUk4aR3MEU">2022's Bluey episode where Bingo uses an ad-hoc communication device</a> that you can fall back on.</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/17we80g/comment/k9hv1ip/"><img src="/images/2024/dance-in-ohio.jpeg" class='pic right' style='width: 250px;' alt="cast photo from the musical How to Dance in Ohio" /></a>
<p>Top of the list is probably when the latest season of The Mandalorian finally got back to what we all liked it for in the first place -- Baby Yoda (Grogu) adorably annoying that guy in the metal helmet. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl0EI44nMXE"><img src="/images/2024/grogu.jpeg" class='pic left' style='width: 350px;' alt="Grogu from the Mandalorian saying 'Yes Yes Yes' through a droid control interface" /></a>
The little champ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl0EI44nMXE">managed his first vocalizations via droid suit</a>, though I think it's clear he had a lot more he'd be capable of expressing than just yes/no. Brandon Sanderson also included a deaf character with a writing tablet in his new Princess-Bride-esque book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tress-Emerald-Sea-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/1250899656">Tress of the Emerald Sea</a>, with a swing at garnering sympathy for anyone whose speech device ever broke unexpectedly, and the new musical <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/17we80g/comment/k9hv1ip/">How to Dance in Ohio</a> with its autistic acting cast offered some stage time to a part-time AAC user with a phone as their device.</p>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Day-No-Words-Tiffany-Hammond/dp/1736949799"><img src="/images/2024/day-with-no-words.jpg" class='pic right' style='width: 150px;' alt="book cover for A Day With No Words" /></a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1VWPgCB_pU"><img src="/images/2024/ahren-belisle.png" class='pic left' style='width: 250px;' alt="photo of Ahren Belisle on America's Got Talent" /></a>
<p>Beyond that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1VWPgCB_pU">Ahren Belisle competed on America's Got Talent</a> with his "Silent But Deadly" stand-up routines, Tiffany Hammond's new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Day-No-Words-Tiffany-Hammond/dp/1736949799">A Day With No Words</a> was released, and <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/nonspeaking-woman-with-autism-denied-effective-communication-tools-now-education-advocate/">Jordyn Zimmerman</a> continues to draw headlines for her education advocacy efforts. Not bad for AAC representation for 2023! Here's to hoping 2024 ends up with even more AAC representation (we're looking at you, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5012320/">Disney+</a>).</p>

<h2>In Memoriam</h2>
<img src="/images/2024/karen-owens.png" class='pic left' style='width: 180px;' alt="photo of Karen Owens"/>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/wespeakpodd/">Karen Owens of We Speak PODD</a> - "Karen's fighting spirit knew no bounds. She had an incredible heart and passion for children with special needs, especially those without a voice. Her passion led her to create 'We Speak PODD', an organization empowering families to help their children communicate. Through this remarkable initiative, Karen touched the lives of many families, who often feel unsupported and overlooked, by providing them with the tools and support they needed."</p>

<img src="https://isaac-online.org/wp-content/uploads/Leila-Nunes-2-1-768x575.jpg" class='pic right' style='width: 200px;' alt="photo of Leila Nunes" />
Additional tributes are <a href="https://isaac-online.org/english/news/in-memoriam/">listed on the ISAAC web site</a>, including
Leila Nunes, Rosemary Crossley, Judith Heumann, and David Yoder. We also wish to pay tribute to individuals who used AAC either part- or full-time, who passed away in 2023, and hope their determination and effort to assert their identities can continue to inspire others to follow suit.


<h2>AAC Systems</h2>
<p>When it comes to something as important as communication, it's good to have options! Fortunately, there haven't been a lot of systems drop out of existence over the last year, which can trigger a difficult transition for some. Here are the most common AAC systems mentioned by our survey responses, listed in order of frequency.</p>

<h2>How Do You Say</h2>
<p>Sometimes we forget that there's apps, and then there's vocabularies -- and the two don't always directly intersect. Some apps support multiple vocabularies, and some vocabularies are offered on multiple systems, and out hope here at OpenAAC is to see more sharing and reuse over time, so it's also good to think specifically about which vocabularies are getting the most play right now, and figure out what they might be doing right. Check out any vocabularies you may not be familiar with from the list below!</p>

<p>Many vocabularies are also offered in more than one grid size. Here's the most common grid sizes reported by our survey respondents. 60-buttons was by far the most commong grid size, with 84-buttons coming in second. While there can be important reasons to start with a smaller grid size, it's important to remember the <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/learn-aac/choosing-a-grid-size">inherent limitations that come with them</a>.</p>

<img src="/images/2024/grids.png" class='pic' style='width: 600px;' alt="bar graph showing frequency of different grid sizes" />

<h2>Up and Coming</h2>
<p>It's not always easy to keep up on where things are headed, but here are some of the topics and apps that bubbled up to the surface in the last year.</p>

<p>First, the apps and new vocabularies that people are discovering:</p>

</a>
<p><img src="/images/2024/playground-board.jpeg" class='pic right' style='width: 400px;' alt="picture of a permanently mounted AAC board on a playground" />
When it comes to things other than apps, there have also been some notable topics come up recently. <a href="https://www.meaningfulspeech.com/blog/misconceptions-aac-and-GLP">Gestalt Language Processing</a> is a popular topic, with differring opinions about degrees of adoption, and AAC vendors still looking for the best way to incorporate the concept. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/uoigao/do_playground_aac_boards_really_get_used/">Playground AAC boards</a> continue to grow in popularity as an additional communication tool in a setting that can be hard on many personal AAC systems.</p>

<p>The growth of AI has also begun making its way into the world of AAC, with hopes of personalized or natural-sounding word/phrase suggestions, and more robust language models. Literacy efforts continue to grow for AAC users, who historically have received less literacy instruction than their peers, and multi-language support is becoming a more-frequent ask for AAC app and vocabulary developers. There also continues to be a push across the AAC community to adopt more neurodiverse-friendly approaches to AAC instruction and implementation.</p>

<p>On top of all that, we asked people what "crazy" ideas they had for the future of AAC. Here are some of the most interesting topics and ideas submitted: Tactile keyboards, predictive inflections, synthesized voices with emotions, see-through screens, waterproof AAC, free-for-all AAC, coaching model to replace evaluations, cheaper flexible mounting, gaming to learn AAC, wearable AAC, scribble a sketch and AI makes it into a symbol, brain thoughts directly to words.
</p>

<h2>Who's Who</h2>
<p>We can't all be as big as, say, Taylor Swift, but we do have our own Style of celebrities here in the world of AAC, gaining a Reputation for themselves, both during the school year and the Cruel Summer between. They know that AAC learning can be Delicate, but these folks are Fearless in doing their part to advocate, teach, train and share, with great ideas of how to Shake it Off and get Out of the Woods of complacency, all in the name of helping AAC users grow for themselves without any Bad Blood. AAC community at large is better for their part in it!</p>

<p>First, we have to mention <a href="https://speaker.ussaac.org/">the presenters of USSAAC's Speaker Connection</a>. These are all AAC users, who offer their paid services to present at schools, conferences, seminars, etc. to help spread awareness and ensure that AAC representation comes from AAC users themselves, not just teachers and therapists.</p>

<h2>AAC Acceptance</h2>
<p>Respondents for our survey included AAC users, therapists, teachers, family members, and others in the AAC community. We wanted to try to get a general glimpse of how AAC is being received and treated, so we asked respondents the following questions.</p>

<div style='width: 48%; display: inline-block; float: left;'>
<p><i>Based on your experiences, how would you say most people receive or react to AAC users over the past year?</i></p>
<img src="/images/2024/pie1.png" class='pic' style='width: 100%;' alt="Pie chart showing survey responses"/>

<div style='width: 48%; margin-left: 2%; display: inline-block; float: left;'>
<p><i>Based on your experiences, how would you say the people's perception of AAC users has changed over the past year?</i></p>

<h2>Thank You, Come Again!</h2>
<p>We hope this <b>State of AAC 2024</b> report has been useful for you. It was definitely fun and educational for us to put together! We know that the world of AAC will keep evolving, and our hope is that over time the expertise and perspectives that lead the way can spread more broadly and more uniformly, so everyone can benefit from the newest and greatest work happening different places throughout the world!</p>

<p>OpenAAC is a relatively new non-profit working to increase awareness, global access, and collaboration related to AAC. We plan to release this report annually, and we may have a few other tricks up our sleeves here in the next bit, so keep an eye out for additional news from us!</p>
