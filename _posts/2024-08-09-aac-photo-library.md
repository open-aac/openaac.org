<p>At OpenAAC, we want everyone to be fully aware of AAC.
Sometimes that means just knowing that AAC exists and that
people use it as a valid tool for communication, but it can 
also mean learning that AAC has uses outside the classroom,
outside the home, or beyond what someone is used to seeing.</p>

<p>We want pictures of AAC users to show up in more places,
and with a broader variety of representations. As such, OpenAAC
is now collecting and sharing an open-licensed library of
photographs of people using AAC, called the 
<a href="/photos.html">AAC Photo Library</a>. All images are released with
a public domain or Creative Commons license, which means that
publications, bloggers and other content creators can use them
without first needing to wait for explicit permission, provided
that they properly attribute the photos in their works.</p>

<h2>Photos Raise Awareness</h2>

<p>Photos of people using AAC don't just benefit the 
uninformed -- although it can be great for someone to see just
how many ways and places AAC can be leveraged. The AAC 
Photo Library also helps AAC users to see people like them
who take advantage of AAC in their everyday lives.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>
<p>Anyone can contribute to the AAC Photo Library. Photos in the library don't have to be professionally-done, as a mix of 
posed and candid photographs provides the broadest scope of use.
If you have photos you would like to share with the AAC 
community and with the world, you can <a href="https://forms.gle/guFDpuHPkggXAeBe6">submit them using our upload form</a>. Please remember that you must have permission from the image's 
copyright holder (AND we strongly encourage you to get permission from the AAC user themself) before it can be shared to the library.</p>

<p>We hope the AAC Photo Library can be a useful resource
for people at every stage of their AAC journey, and can help
raise awareness of AAC and the broad variety of uses it serves
in the world today.</p>
