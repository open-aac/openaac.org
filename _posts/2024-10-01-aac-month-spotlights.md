<p>AAC Awareness Month is upon us yet again! This year, just like
every year, there will be discounts on AAC products, training
materials on best practices, and thoughtful posts to help 
people rethink their mindset and approach when it comes to AAC.</p>

<p>While all of this is important, we want to make sure that
we don't lose sight of the purpose of all that work and research.
This month we will be highlighting the people who use AAC
themselves. Some people are proficienty with AAC and continue
to advocate and raise awareness. Some are just barely getting
introduced to AAC and are hitting personal milestones. Some are
somewhere in the middle and still pushing through in spite of
difficulties and setbacks. ALL of them deserve to be celebrated!
Check back through the month or follow us to see
the new spotlights as they are added through the month!</p>

<h2 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Jaron</h2>
<div style='margin-left: -20px; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;'>Adult in Arizona with Cerebral Palsy, 5+ yrs experience using AAC</div>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1gyJrUdGkhmc9Ol5G-7KZjjuYDT4JluMo&sz=w500" class='pic left' style='width: 250px;'/>
Jaron has grown leaps and bounds over the past couple of years. He is dedicated and enthusiastic in learning to read, write, share stories and pray with others. He recently completed a mission where he was given opportunities to give talks, bear his testimony and give the opening prayers. Jaron is sound proud and excited to have opportunities to communicate with others. He now volunteers for opportunities to speak publicly. Jaron has gone from 1-word communication exchanges to 3-4 words more consistently. With time, he prepares much longer sentences and talks. He loves writing letters and cards to friends and family. Whenever anyone is sad, sick or going through a tough time, he says, "We feel" and frequently asks about them. He looks forward to opportunities to meet others and always displays a BIG smile when greeting others with a vocalization of "HEYYY" combined with the use of AAC to say, "What's Happening!?"

The first word Jaron learned to spell (independently and spontaneously) with word prediction was "kindness." This truly speaks to his heart and compassion for others.

Jaron will be presenting and attending for the first time at an AAC conference this year at Closing the Gap 2024. He will be sharing his journey with sharing, storing and saving narratives to share with others.

<h2 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>JT</h2>
<div style='margin-left: -20px; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;'>7-9yr old in Utah with Autism, 1-2 yrs experience using AAC</div>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=17MougqQ5l4FNoUHObuGAxHVD_AiQSy2h&sz=w500" class='pic left' style='width: 250px;'/>
JT is learning to access his device independently. He is also learning to use it to say hi and interact with others instead of only requesting items. 

JT is a very intelligent little boy, but people often underestimate him because of his communication difficulties. As he learns the best way to express himself, he's going to rock the world.

<a name="mateo"></a>
<h2 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Mateo</h2>
<div style='margin-left: -20px; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;'>Adult in Ohio with Apraxia & Dysarthria, 5+ yrs experience using AAC</div>
Mateo is doing a lot of amazing things to educate people about AAC, but I think the coolest thing he’s doing is visiting classrooms and talking to kids about AAC, disability and inclusion. He’s talked with over 1,500 students in grades K-6.  He’s telling his story and talking about himself so kids see he’s not really all that different. He has hobbies, interests, a job and dreams about his future. He is asked questions about his experiences, such as teasing, and he shares his stories about school and how he learned to use his SGD.  He’s proud of who he is and loves to meet students just learning to use AAC. He is teaching peers how to be good communication partners and just plain good friends. Moreover, teachers and other educational team members see firsthand what’s possible when everyone works together and really believes in a student. 

Mateo is incredibly outgoing. He loves meeting new people in the community and is happy to talk to anyone about AAC. He sparks conversations at the grocery store, in the library and at the airport. He’s so glad his SGD lets him connect to others.

<h2 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Andy</h2>
<div style='margin-left: -20px; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;'>Adult in Kansas with Autism & PMM2-CDG, 5+ yrs experience using AAC</div>
Andy loves having communication with people with his AAC.
He loves being a part of communications with everyone, and doesn't want to be left out.

<a name="himani"></a>
<h2 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Himani</h2>
<div style='margin-left: -20px; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;'>13-16yo in California with Autism & Anxiety, 5+ yrs experience using AAC</div>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1rnbaDWZ8pnW6_7NyZ2xI8nca07gXtldi&sz=w500" class='pic left' style='width: 250px;'/>
Himani was educationally neglected in her school.  She was denied access to general education and there were no expectations that she would ever communicate.  In Spring 2020 Himani was asked to type on a computer.  Without anyone touching her or the computer she was able to type a three word sentence.  It took her 45 minutes or longer to write a sentence at first.  Over time her hand strength and dexterity improved and she was able to communicate well using the app Proloquo4Text.

In the next year she would move to using a Unity PRC device, which increased her communication speeds even more.  Since then Himani has made several presentations in settings from her class to large conferences.  She has worked as a PRC Ambassador.  Himani and her mother and her local librarian have developed  AAC Awareness Month programs for their community and started two ongoing programs for AAC users - Story Time for AAC and an AAC social group.  She also maintains all As in general education.  She hopes to one day be a psychiatrist.
