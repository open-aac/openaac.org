<p>Welcome to year two of our annual reporting on the
world of AAC! It can be hard to keep track of everything
happening around AAC, and while there are online 
communities that can help, many people aren't actively
immersed in AAC, but we want to give them an easy way
to keep up to speed, so we've collected all of the
AAC "stuff" from the last year into one place!</p>

<p>The <b>State of AAC</b> is a mix of looking backward
and forward, seeing where we've come from and where
we hope to go. If you read the report from last year, 
you'll see that we've added and adjusted a few things.
We'll probably change up some of the quetsions every
year. The report is drawn from multiple sources, and
includes participation from AAC users, families and
specialists from around the country and the world.</p>

<h2>Pop Culture</h2>
<a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/out-of-my-mind/5U9QeQMDIDaj">
<img src="/images/2025/out_of_my_mind.webp" class='pic left' style='width: 400px;' alt="clip from TV Movie, Out of My Mind" /></a>
The Dumbo-scale elephant in the room this year is the 
<a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/out-of-my-mind/5U9QeQMDIDaj">
Disney+ 
adaptation of Sharon Draper’s book Out of My Mind</a>. If you 
haven’t read the book recently, you might not notice any 
differences shifting it to the small screen. There were some 
much-needed advocacy updates, and some tweaks to the plot, but 
the film got enough right that the overall reception seemed 
positive. It tried to thread the needle of hitting the feels 
for parents and advocates, AAC users themselves, and the 
general population, which is no mean feat.

The real gut-punch is a blink-and-you-miss it scene where
an unnoticed girl in the special needs classroom is smart
enough to be on the quiz team herself, but, unlike Melody,
it's implied that nobody actually hears her, 
and best-case she gets the
same treatment Melody was getting: listening to an 
audiobook in the corner all the day. This is, unfortunately, 
still too often the norm. Nobody should have to prove
their ability before receiving grade-level instruction.
Check out the clip below:

Beyond that, this year saw the debut of an 
<a href="https://www.talkinbroadway.com/page/ob/05_14_24.html">off-broadway rom-com 
called All of Me</a>
about two wheelchaired AAC users, recognition in the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJrffxMHQ6w">ESPY 
awards for Steve Gleason</a>, a 
<a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/05/jennifer-wexton-speech-congress-voice-app-disability-conversation/">congresswoman using AAC to address 
Congress</a>, a 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTECNar9yG4">live interview with Jordyn Zimmerman</a>, and a new 
<a href="https://www.rideaheadfilm.com/watch">documentary on the coming-of-age experiences</a> of AAC
user Samuel Habib. We also heard there was an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/1h7v7rt/netflix_show_later_daters/">AAC user 
highlighted in an episode of Later Daters</a> on Netflix, 
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb7_Uwfh5ic">a segment on Daniel Tiger</a> as well.

<img src="/images/2025/telepathy-tapes.webp" class='pic right' style='width: 300px; max-width: 100%;' alt=''/>
2024 was also a year where a lot of attention went to aided-spelling 
AAC strategies S2C and RPM. These strategies are considered 
an evolution of Facilitated Communication (FC), no longer 
relying on direct physical touch, and their adoption is a sensitive 
topic. As such, we will just note media related to 
aided-spelling that came out in 2024, including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h1rcLyznK0">Spellers</a>
documentary, the film 
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/tell-them-you-love-me-release-date-news">Tell Them You Love Me</a> about 
Derrick Johnson’s FC interactions with Anna Stubblefield who 
was convicted of sexual assault, and Ky Dickens’ popular 
podcast <a href="https://thetelepathytapes.com/">The Telepathy Tapes</a>, 
which proposes that non-speaking 
autistics are able to tap into another realm of consciousness. 
Because of the sensitive nature of aided-spelling, we will 
refrain from commenting on these media events, other than to 
emphasize that individual-driven communication should be the 
end-goal for all AAC implementations, and that non-speaking 
AAC users should receive the same level of education and 
support as their peers regardless of whether they have 
proved that they are “in there”.

All in all, plenty happened around AAC this last year! Most people 
still probably get very little
exposure to AAC users in the real world, but it's a good sign
that there was more than one noteworthy appearance in our
popular culture last year!
One other mention is the new children’s book 
<a href="Carlos' Winter Adventures: Two AAC Stories  (symbolated)">“Carlos' Winter 
Adventures: Two AAC Stories”</a> which includes symbolated text. 
Symbolated implementations are now 
<a href="https://www.aacvoices.com/blog/symbol-supported-text">discouraged by some 
AAC experts</a>, but the book did come out this year and so 
it warrants at least a mention.


<div style='clear: both;'></div>

<h2>AAC Systems</h2>
<p>Last year was another without any major end-of-life
announcements for apps. Tobii-Dynavox received some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/1cxdn27/td_snap_subscription_update/">mixed 
attention</a> when they announced a subscription-only pricing
model that effectively raised the price for consumers 
on the TD Snap app. CBoard also adjusted their model to
a free-baseline-paid-extras approach. A few new products 
arrived, including <a href="https://www.flexspeak.com/">FlexSpeak</a>, 
<a href="https://speakanyway.com/">Speak Anyway</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.mosaicvoiceaac.com/">Mosaic Voice</a>.
Not all of them are ready for prime time, but if you're up
for giving feedback they would all love to hear from you.</p>

<p>As far as app popularity, below are the apps our survey 
respondents mentioned, sorted by number of mentions. TD Snap
and Weave Chat both made noticeable jumps in people's awareness,
though it remains to be seen what will happen with TD Snap's
new pricing.</p>

<h2>AAC Vocabulary</h2>
<p>We've said it before, and we'll said it again: vocabularies
are different than apps. The conversation around vocabularies
has started to shift this year as more people differentiate
between the app that delivers a vocabulary, and the vocabulary
itself -- helped in part by increased awareness of the Grid
 app and its broad range of vocabularies. TD Snap seems to
 have grown in popularity primary because of increased acceptance
 of its newer vocabulary, TD Snap Motor Plan. Also notable
 is the "Morgan" board, a robust AAC vocabulary created
 by Morgan, an AAC researcher and user, for Weave Chat AAC.</p>

<p>Please remember that while some vocabularies are 
app-specific, that is mainly because the app vendor has chosen
to keep it that way. Most vocabularies don't actually have
unique enough features that they couldn't
be ported to other apps. Our hope is that, with time, the idea
of porting vocabularies across apps will gain more widespread
acceptance. This would truly be a boon for AAC users, who could
then mix and match the app and vocabulary combination that
worked best for them.</p>

<p>Many vocabularies are also offered in more than one grid size. 
Here's the most common grid sizes reported by our survey 
respondents. 60-ish-buttons is the sweet spot again this year, 
and the 84-button grid size is still favored next, but there
were more 70-ish and 30-ish grids reported this year than before.
It's important to choose a grid size that works best for
each individual communicator, and we strongly encourage everyone
to think hard before implementing a grid with fewer buttons,
given the <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/learn-aac/choosing-a-grid-size">inherent 
limitations that come with them</a>.</p>

<img src="/images/2025/grids.png" class='pic' style='width: 600px; max-width: 100%;' alt="bar graph showing frequency of different grid sizes" />

<h2>Up and Coming</h2>
<img src="/images/2025/ai-aac.jpeg" class='pic right' style='width: 300px; max-width: 100%;' alt=''/>
<p>It's not just AAC apps that are showing up new on the scene.
With new technologies, new features, new hardware and new
ideas, there's a lot to digest! We asked our survey respondents
to share what innovations they thought could have an impact
in the world of AAC, and here's what they shared back:</p>

<p>Obviously AI is a big deal, though there's still work to do
nailing down all the best ways to leverage it for AAC. AI voices and 
emotional responses (<a href="https://avazapp.com/blog/expressive-tones-on-avaz-aac/">implemented by Avaz</a>) are interesting. Using 
AI to generate on-the-fly topic boards has potential 
(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/cboardAAC/posts/-coming-soon-cbuilder-ai-board-generator-just-enter-your-description-and-hit-cre/600277292610203/">CBoard 
has announced this feature as coming soon</a>), although with 
possible motor planning tradeoffs. One additional proposal is 
to use AI to recommend efficiency changes to a user-specific 
vocabulary layout. This area will need time to settle in.</p>

<a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/support/proloquo/basics/proloquo-thinking-space"><img src="/images/2025/thinking-space.png" class='pic left' style='width: 250px; max-width: 100%;' alt=''/></a>
<p>In feature-land, Proloquo introduced a new section 
called <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/support/proloquo/basics/proloquo-thinking-space">Thinking Space</a>, which 
is a mix between a whiteboard and a sentence box. Just over a 
year ago TD Snap added a new feature called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQovB82MBcM">Vocabulary Filter</a>. 
This is similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkKbxCXkzwE">CoughDrop’s Focus Words</a> feature. And as 
mentioned above there are opportunities for AI features 
across the gamut. And last but definitely not least,
<a href="https://bridgingvoice.org/news/elevenlabs-bridging-voice-partnership/">Bridging Voice secured
a partnership with ElevenLabs</a> to provide free individualized
AI voices to ALS/MND patients worldwide.</p>

<img src="/images/2025/vocab_filter.webp" class='pic right' style='width: 300px; max-width: 100%;' alt=''/>
<p>There's still a lot of questions and excitement
around Gestalt Language Processing and how to best support it
in AAC apps, and respondents also emphasized some
back-to-basics approaches like <a href="https://praacticalaac.org/praactical/how-we-do-it-smorres-and-partner-augmented-input-with-dr-jill-senner-matthew-baud/">Aided Language Stimulation</a>
and communication partner training that could use more attention.
Additionally, multilingual support got plenty of shout-outs,
and AI came up in just about every text box available on the
survey.</p>

<p>Moving into other tech, <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/new-brain-computer-interface-allows-man-with-als-to-speak-again/2024/08#:~:text=The%20new%20BCI%20breaks%20the%20communication%20barrier&text=The%20computer%20can%20then%20read,arms%20and%20legs%20(tetraparesis).">Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)</a>
show a lot of potential. Most are still in the research phase,
though some are beginning to gain some momentum. There is also 
enthusiasm about <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/">Apple’s new eye tracking</a>
software implementation in the iPad Pro models, with a lot of
hope that the technology will continue to improve without
too much of an added price point.</p>

<p>Beyond all of that, we asked people what futuristic ideas 
folks had for the world of AAC. Many of the responses 
were for things that 
probably shouldn’t be considered radical. Cross-device 
synchronization of changes, robust AAC for all, involvement 
by AAC users in app development, support for split screens or 
easier back buttons in some apps, neurodiversity-affirming
practice, required AAC curriculum for
SLP grad students -- all got a mention.</p>

<p>A few people mentioned the need to move beyond traditional 
grid-based layouts for AAC. We’re curious what people think 
that means, so please hit us up in <a href="https://www.openaac.org/contact.html">chat</a> or via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/openaac/">Facebook</a> if you
have ideas there! Additionally, there is interest in more seamless 
multilingual support and code switching. Finally, there is a 
growing push for more open source and open-licensed materials, 
which we at OpenAAC are super excited to see.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy development is the noticeable pushback against 
the term, “presume competence”. In the recent past, <a href="https://leader.pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/leader.FMP.23122018.10">criticism  
of the term</a> wasn't always well-accepted by the community, and 
many said that a more measured approach equated to requiring 
proof of capacity before AAC could be considered. But now, 
because of the increased attention that S2C and RPM are 
receiving as possible communication supports, those who caution 
against them are distancing themselves from the term more 
strongly than before. Many seem to be <a href="https://www.aacvoices.com/blog/presume-potential">adopting the term “presume potential”</a>
instead as a more accurate but still enabling rallying point.</p>

<h2>Shouldas and Couldas</h2>
<div style='float: right; width: 300px;'>

<div style='width: 250px; font-size: 14px; margin: -10px auto 5px; line-height: 17px; text-align: center;'><i>AI-generated image from the prompt, "image representing skepticism of AI use in AAC"</i></div>
</div>
<p>When it comes to research, there will always be important
questions to ask. Respondents emphasized the need for more
insight regarding the implementation of 
gestalts in AAC, as well as the impact of vocabulary sizes and 
layouts. As alternative access methods continue to evolve, there 
is a continued need to assess their efficacy. Also the hype 
around AI, some argue, needs to be tempered by systematic 
investigation and research. Additional research topics 
mentioned include whole-district vocabulary implementations, 
part-time AAC use, multilingual development, aided-spelling 
implementations, communication partner training approaches, 
the impact of ABA strategies on AAC, the effect of empowerment 
on AAC users, etc.</p>

<img src="/images/2025/alt-access.png" class='pic left' style='width: 300px; max-width: 100%;' alt=''/>
<p>The wish list for AAC is pretty broad. Top to bottom it 
includes things like more trainings, more eye gaze options, 
open-licensed vocabularies, bigger lending libraries, better 
device cases, more multilingual AAC support, GIF and videos 
within apps, better keyguards and switch access, app support 
on phones, better word prediction, automated background removal 
for photos added to buttons, and universal core options. 
Looking at the list from a birds-eye view, there’s a clear 
need for better alternative access solutions, more 
organizational support for AAC implementations, and better 
adoption of useful features across more AAC apps.</p>

<p>That last one is high on our list here at OpenAAC. We don’t 
ever want a cool feature to sit in a single app. A lot of app 
providers have limited R&D resources to begin with, so we’ll 
add our own personal wish list item, which is more discussion
around how AAC apps can be better, and less animosity around 
apps implementing each other’s great features. In a perfect
 world, an AAC user could pair up whichever AAC app worked 
 best for them with whichever AAC vocabulary worked best for 
 them.</p>

<h2>Can You Introduce Me?</h2>
<p>It's easy to think about AAC as just the apps, but
the reality is there are people working hard -- above and 
beyond what they need to do for their job -- to make sure
AAC implementations are working as well as they can, and to
ensure as many people as possible have access to the information
and tools they need to feel empowered and ready to help. We 
want to thank all of those people, whether they were 
named in our survey or not!</p>

<h2>Something's Missing</h2>
<p>This year we asked a new question, “What (if anything) do 
you find commonly needing to be added to pre-populated AAC 
vocabularies?”. There were bound to be some givens like 
personally-important names and locations. But the full (rank-ordered) 
list is something that we hope will be useful for AAC 
vocabulary developers to consider.</p>

</span>
</p>

<p>One big takeaway is that 
AAC vocabularies need to be refreshed from time to time. 
Things like pop culture references, slang, cuss words, 
technology, and even medical terminology change often 
enough that some of the AAC vocabularies that have been 
around for a while can feel pretty dated when you dig down 
a level or two. It’s not a simple problem to solve, though, 
since slang and culture changes regularly, and tends
to be generational anyway. Even still, there are some areas
like human anatomy, religious terminology and self-advocacy
that could be implemented once and make a big difference.</p>

<p>A few survey respondents specifically called out the
lack of school-topic vocabulary in many AAC apps. There was
a surprising tone of animosity against 
<a href="https://aaccommunity.net/caac_slp/the-descriptive-teaching-method-and-aac/">the descriptive
teaching method</a>, which emphasizes repeated use of core
words over short-term vocabulary needed for a specific class.
People are pushing back on 
sub-5,000-word vocabulary
examples for using descriptive teaching as en excuse for
not finding ways to include broader educational vocabulary.
The descriptive teaching method definitely provides value for
communicators who have any kind of selection constraints,
but it does seem like both approaches can be accommodated
in the same vocabulary through deeper, optional levels
of navigation. This is something we will be
investigating further in our own vocabulary research work.</p>

<h2>The Ick in AAC</h2>
<p>Hand-over-hand and forced compliance are still the 
most-mentioned, and one of the most problematic topics 
mentioned. 
<a href="https://www.aacvoices.com/blog/aac-prompt-hierarchy">Communicative independence</a> is a critical component of autonomy, 
and honoring that independence is what separates authentic 
communication from performative assessment.</p>

<img src="/images/2025/ipad-backpack.jpeg" class='pic right' style='width: 300px; max-width: 100%;' alt=""/>
<p>Additionally, many people mentioned the issue of AAC 
devices not being constantly available, either because it’s 
stuck in a bag somewhere or because it’s taken away as a 
behavioral consequence. Some also mentioned the concern of AAC 
communication only being acknowledged or honored if it is 
on-topic. There are also still pockets of practice where the 
outdated mindset of proving ability before getting access to 
a high-tech device exists.</p>

<p>Over-prompting and too-short wait times are still an issue, 
as are vocabulary grids with only a few large buttons, and a 
continued lack of literacy instruction in tandem with 
communication supports. School staff are prone to avoid 
modeling or aided language stimulation because of difficulty 
finding the words, and there were varied examples of how AAC 
is still considered “less than” speech-based communication.</p>

<h2>Assessments</h2>
<p>Assessments are an important tool for consistent
evaluation and assessment on individual needs and growth.
While at times they are overemphasized, they can be
helpful when taken in context using a collaborative 
approach. Each individual is unique, but the 
hard truth is that many areas do not have access to practitioners
with enough AAC expertise, in which case AAC-specific assessment
tools become even more important.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the most common assessment tools
reported for 2024, sorted in order of frequency:</p>

<h2>AAC Acceptance</h2>
<p>One area we will probably change every year on the State of 
AAC report is the few questions on how community acceptance 
and teaching is going. Our first of these questions this year was, "In 
your experience over the last year, how often were AAC users 
treated and taught in a manner appropriate for their age or 
grade 
level?" Unfortunately, a majority of the responses indicated
this is happening half the time or less. The good news is that
this gives us something specific to work on! School environments
are probably the ideal starting point for change, as staff
can have this brought to their attention and trainings
can hopefully help improve the situation for AAC learners.</p>

your experience over the last year, how often were AAC users 
treated and taught in a manner appropriate for their age or 
grade 
level?"</div>
</div>

<p>The responses to the second question are also concerning, but do
helps give a clear picture of where to improve. The question,
"Which aspects of communication do you see usually being 
taught or supported for AAC users?" had a mix of responses. 
Almost 
all respondents said "Requests/Needs" were being taught, and 
half reported "social interactions", but only a quarter 
are getting opportunities to learn personal reactions and opinions, one in five
are getting literacy instruction, and only 7% for anything
to do with creativity and make-believe. This matches with
anecdotal reports that too much instruction for AAC users
is still focusing only on nouns, daily schedule, and 
obligatory hello/goodbye messages.</p>

  taught or supported for AAC users?"</div>
</div>

<p>Again, this is good news in a way, because it gives us
something pretty easy to teach and work on! There is clearly
low-hanging fruit we can harvest by introducing AAC users
to grade-level material, giving them more opportunities to
share their own ideas and opinions, and investing time
into literacy instruction. Think how much of a difference
these areas can make in improving communicator autonomy
and self-empowerment!</p>

<h2>Making the Grade</h2>
<p>This is another new section we're starting this year, but
we feel like it's an important one. There are multiple aspects
that go into having a healthy ecosystem, and we've reached out
to experts in various areas of the AAC field to help generate
a report card on how we're doing on the whole. We'll be posting
a more detailed summary of this report card soon, so stay tuned
for additional quotes, insights and recommendations. But in the
mean time, here's a report card for the AAC Ecosystem, Full
Year 2024:</p>

<p>So... Maybe not the prettiest report card in the world.
But it's definitely not a lost cause! Hopefully we can
get some of those grades up by next year, and improve 
the health of the AAC ecosystem at large. We were happy to see
higher marks for family supports and individualization, as
those areas are probably some of the most pivotal to effective 
AAC implementation -- but getting an F for Education definitely
stings. We'll dig more into these results in another
post soon, so stay tuned!</p>


<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
<p>There are so many people who contribute to this annual report,
and we want to give a big thank you to those named below, and
to all the others who helped spread the word, shared their
personal insights, or just did their small part behind the
scenes to keep lifting us all up and help AAC make the
most difference that it can for people all over the world.
Thank you again, all of you!</p>
