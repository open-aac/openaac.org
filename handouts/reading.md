<p>Reading is a great opportunity to think outside of our environment, learn new things, and find topics for discussion. However, many AAC users receive significantly less exposure to books and reading experiences than their peers. Reading to, with, or at the same time as someone else is a connecting experience that can create lasting memories and many chances for growth.</p>
<h2>Interacitve AAC Reading Ideas</h2>

<a href="/cpp">Interative Reading Handout</a><br/>
<p>The Interactive Reading Handout provides ideas and suggestions to help encourage AAC communication during reading time. These ideas can be used in an individual or group setting, for beginning or experiened AAC users, with picture books, chapter books, or other reading or even video opportunities. This handout is free to use and share online or in-person as needed.</p>
<p>NOTE: This content focuses specifically on communication and interaction through co-reading experiences, but does not focus explicitly on learning to read. We heartily believe that AAC users can learn to read independently and deserve literacy instruction to help make that happen, and encourage the use of literacy activities and tools to help make that happen.</p>
<p>OpenAAC Members have access to additional handouts that can be downloaded, and shared privately as needed. These handouts provide additional detail on implementing co-reading strategies and introduce additional topics to help deepend co-reading time. They can be accessed through your OpenAAC Member Login.</p>
