  Some people have a knack for fixing problems or
  coming up with ideas before others have even noticed
  a need. We want to honor those folks, and help bring
  awareness to the high-quality solutions that exist
  in the world of AAC. To help with all of that, OpenAAC
  hosts an annual awards program for all things AAC.
</p>
<h2>The knAAC Awards</h2>

<p>
  Short for "Keepers and Noteworthies in AAC", the knAAC Awards
  is not like most other awards programs. Like a lot of things 
  related to AAC, the knAAC Awards may be different than you
  expect. Most everyone working on AAC-related projects are
  doing it for really good reasons, so it doesn't make sense to
  pick and say "this one's the best". Instead, the knAAC awards
  are a chance to highlight ALL of the nominees while giving
  someone a chance to shine.
</p>
<p>
  The knAAC Awards are given to products, 
  organizations, and individuals voted as "keepers" for their
  long-term quality, or "noteworthies" for their current
  contributions -- or both! The goal, again, is to help bring
  attention to those who are making a difference for good
  in the AAC community on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<p>
  Categories include awards for apps, vocabularies,
  web sites, devices, and individuals -- there's a lot going on
  in AAC, if you didn't know! And that's part of why we do
  this, to help everyone know what possibilities are out there,
  and who to follow to stay on top of the latest work and
  research. As you browse the lists of nominees, keep an eye
  out for new ideas and interesting possibilities -- 
  information about AAC doesn't always make it everywhere it
  needs to, so hopefully these awards can help with that!
  
</p>
<p>
  Nominations are collected by the OpenAAC team, with feedback
  from industry experts, and based partly on the results of our
  annual <a href="/2024/02/13/state-of-aac-2024">State of AAC</a> 
  data collection surveys.
  Highlights are chosen by ranked votes during the open voting
  period, combined with selections from our judging team. 
  After the voting has closed, we will compute tallies
  based on all the voted submitted and announce that year's 
  highlights in each category.
