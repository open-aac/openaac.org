  Welcome to the second annual knAAC Awards! Short for
  "Keepers and Noteworthies in AAC", the knAAC Awards
  are all about highlighting the wonderful work happening
  in the world of AAC! We want to help celebrate the 
  unsung heroes of AAC who go above and beyond, not for fame or money, but because they see the impact it can make for underserved populations around the world.
</p>
<p>
  All of these people and products have done impressive
  work, and we are grateful for how their 
  contributions have helped AAC users. Our goal is not
  to run a popularity contest, but instead to try
  to bring attention to all of the nominees, and 
  maybe have a little fun like a chilli cook-off
  or voting for our favorite superheroes.
</p>
<p>
  You may vote in as many or as few categories as you would like, but please take time to review all the candidates in a single category before voting on them. Final results will be tallied once the voting with has closed, and we will announce the winners here!
</p>
<p style='display: none;'>
  Voting has ended, and the final results are 
  displayed below! Highlights are selected based primarily
  on popular vote, with additional input provided
  by our judging team. Only the first two candidates are shown in ranked order. Congratulations to the 
  highlighted candidates and thank you again
  to the over 100 nominees in 18 different categories!

      </a>
      <span class='sub'>
        Despite the growing amount of AAC information that is available, parents of children with very limited language struggle to support their children’s communicative development. Stepping Into AAC is a program to support your individual’s communication journey.
        Stepping Into AAC 
        Introduces you to Augmentative/Alternative Communication (AAC)
        Guides you through the early months of using new communication tools and strategies
        Offers resources to engage school teams and other caregivers
        The program is divided into 20 parts with the intention to complete one part a week. There are activities, resources and videos to guide you along the way. Our hope is that you find support and inspiration whether you are just getting started with AAC, seeking momentum or looking to learn more about AAC.

A critical feature of successfully applying the SETT Framework is a shared understanding across the educational team, the student, and the family when it comes to the "who" (student’s characteristics), the "where" (learning environment characteristics), and the "what" (tasks that a student needs to be able to do).

      <span class='sub'>
        HeadMouse replaces the standard computer mouse for people who cannot use or have limited use of their hands. The HeadMouse translates natural movements of a user's head into directly proportional mouse pointer movement – move your head and the mouse pointer follows along. The HeadMouse has a wireless optical sensor which tracks a tiny disposable target worn by the user on his/her forehead, glasses, or even a hat. It works just like a computer mouse, with the mouse pointer being controlled by head movement.

      </a>
      <span class='sub'>
        WordPower by Nancy Inman is a unique vocabulary design for an augmentative/alternative communication device. WordPower combines the features of core vocabulary, spelling and word prediction. The system takes advantage of the fact that while we may have a normal speaking vocabulary of between 10,000 and 30,000 words, a core of just 100 words accounts for approximately 50 percent of words spoken.<br/><br/>
        Nancy has customized WordPower for multiple AAC systems, and it was originally designed for an individual in need of an augmentative communication device based on words. A vocabulary based on pre-stored sentences would not meet his communication needs. Though he could see the advantage of a picture-based system with symbol sequencing, he did not want to learn the complex language coding system. At the same time, he wanted more than a system based on spelling and word prediction. WordPower provided him a fast and efficient language, with minimal time and effort required for learning the system.

        The Crescendo vocabulary offers consistent core word placement, extensive fringe and flexibility. Easy access to “core words” is key for efficient communication. Core words are the high-frequency words, such as “I”, “you”, “go”, “do” that make up most of what we say. But not every AAC vocabulary keeps them in a consistent location. In Crescendo, buttons for core words appear in the same place on the home and fringe pages. This consistency supports learning through motor planning, a process your brain goes through when learning a new skill. Through consistent repetition, you learn to carry out tasks automatically.
