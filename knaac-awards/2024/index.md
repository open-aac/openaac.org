  Welcome to the 2024 knAAC Awards! Short for
  "Keepers and Noteworthies in AAC", the knAAC Awards
  are all about highlighting the wonderful work happening
  in the world of AAC! We want to help celebrate the 
  unsung heroes of AAC in all their different 
  efforts, and we need your help to do it!
</p>
<p>
  All of these people and products have done impressive
  work, and we are grateful for how their 
  contributions have helped AAC users. Our goal is not
  to start a popularity contest, but instead to try
  to bring attention to all of the nominees, and 
  maybe have a little fun like a chilli cook-off
  or voting for our favorite superheroes.
</p>
<p>
  Voting has ended, and the final results are 
  displayed below! Highlights are selected based primarily
  on popular vote, with additional input provided
  by our judging team. Only the first two candidates are shown in ranked order. Congratulations to the 
  highlighted candidates and thank you again
  to the over 100 nominees in 18 different categories!

        WordPower by Nancy Inman is a unique vocabulary design for an augmentative/alternative communication device. WordPower combines the features of core vocabulary, spelling and word prediction. The system takes advantage of the fact that while we may have a normal speaking vocabulary of between 10,000 and 30,000 words, a core of just 100 words accounts for approximately 50 percent of words spoken.<br/><br/>
        Nancy has customized WordPower for multiple AAC systems, and it was originally designed for an individual in need of an augmentative communication device based on words. A vocabulary based on pre-stored sentences would not meet his communication needs. Though he could see the advantage of a picture-based system with symbol sequencing, he did not want to learn the complex language coding system. At the same time, he wanted more than a system based on spelling and word prediction. WordPower provided him a fast and efficient language, with minimal time and effort required for learning the system.
