  There's always a lot going on in the world of AAC! It can be
  hard to keep up on everything, from best practices to 
  new apps and new research to pop culture references. There
  are still pockets of knowledge and experience that aren't
  making their way to the people who need to find them. We
  want to fix that!
</p>
<p>
  Every year at OpenAAC we compile a report to help share all
  the AAC highlights from the past year. But we need your help
  to make it complete! Please take a few minutes to fill out 
  this survey, and help us get a better insight into how things
  are going in general in the world of AAC. As always, we will
  share the results back to the AAC community as we try to help
  open AAC up to more people and opportunities.

  card</b> for one of the survey's respondents, so make sure to fill it out
  while the survey is still open!
