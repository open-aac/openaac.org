## AAC Systems

There are many varied assessment tools used to evaluate an AAC user's
development. Some
assessments are interactive, some are paper-based, etc. Many,
however, are proprietary and require either an up-front purchase,
or a subscription. In line with our initiative at OpenAAC to provide
free, open-licensed resources for families and practitioners, we are 
developing and collecting a library of free assessment tools, based 
on industry best practices. Our goal, as always, is to provide
resources that can help AAC users be enabled and empowered in 
their personal communication strategy.

### Communication Partner Profile (CPP v1)

OpenAAC's first Open Assessment project is the 
<a href="/cpp">Communication Partner Profile</a> 
. This assessment form is intended as a self-reflection tool that communication partners can
fill out to help look for areas where they may be able to
better support AAC users. The questions are based on a collection of
research and best practices regarding AAC supports (references included)
and feedback from AAC users and practitioners.

### More to Come

If you know of free assessment tools which should be included, or you
would like to be involved in the development of additional tools, please
