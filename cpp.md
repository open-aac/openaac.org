(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7b1bVpT49kCpViXRk4q6PfJu4GzmZG-/view">preview</a>) is an assessment form is intended as a self-reflection tool that communication partners can
fill out to help look for areas where they may be able to
better support AAC users. The questions are based on a collection of
research and best practices regarding AAC supports (references included),
and were developed with <u>collaboration from AAC users and practitioners</u>. It typically <u>takes less than 15 minutes</u> to complete.

Anyone can fill out the CPP, share it in their communities, or use it for personal or research purposes. The CPP is designed to be help beginners discover areas where they can learn more, and to help experienced partners continue developing their skills and perspective. You can take it only once, or fill it out again in 6 months or a year and see how things have changed.
