<p>As a non-profit organization, OpenAAC's ongoing efforts
support a diverse community of AAC users, their support teams,
software developers, vendors, and many others. We help raise 
awareness of AAC and continually craft resources that can
help with adoption and creation of high-quality AAC solutions.</p>
<p>We rely on the donations of everyday folks
in the AAC community, in addition to organizational sponsors,
in order to keep our work effective, strategic and unbiased.
Please consider making a donation today to help us continue
our work!</p>

<p>OpenAAC regularly creates resources and performs outreach
and research to further the field of AAC. With a monthly 
subscription of $10USD you can help us continue that work 
by helping us maintain the online services and studies
we need to run in order to be effective. We keep a minimal
staff so that donations can go toward maintaining the 
high quality standards we expect of all the materials,
programs and services that are part of OpenAAC.</p>

<p>In addition to helping our cause
continue forward, members also have access to exclusive 
high-quality AAC support materials, online assessment
and profiling tools, and additional updates on data
gathered by the organization.
</p>

<p>You can sign up for a monthly subscription today,
