<h3>For Everyone</h3>
<a href="/surveys.html"><img src="/images/survey.png" class='participate_preview_pic'/></a>

<p style='margin-top: -15px;'>
  <a href="/surveys.html">Participate in research</a>! We are 
  always running information-gathering surveys, and the 
  more data we collect from these surveys, the more useful they
  are. You can also share the survey links with others, recruit
  more participants, and help us even more! All research is
  released publicly so everyone can benefit.

<h3>For Individuals and Families</h3>
<img src="https://d18vdu4p71yql0.cloudfront.net/libraries/arasaac/family_5.png" class='participate_pic'/>
<p style='margin-top: -15px;'>Talk to your vendors! Tell them how important it is to you that you
  have the freedom to change providers based on the communicator's
  current needs. Tell them that it's your content that you've added
  and personalized over the years, and that you have the right to
  get it back out when the time comes. Send them a link to the 
  <a href="https://www.openboardformat.org">Open Board Format</a> and
  tell them you don't want to get burned next time a product gets
  cancelled or a company gets purchased.

<h3>For Practitioners and Aides</h3>
<img src="https://d18vdu4p71yql0.cloudfront.net/libraries/arasaac/teacher%20(female)_2.png" class='participate_pic'/>
<p style='margin-top: -15px;'>Share your ideas for supporting language learning in 
  the <a href="https://www.coreworkshop.org">Communication Workshop</a>!
  All the activities are open for anyone to use, and are
  contributed by community members like you! When you talk to vendors, ask
  them if they are using oppen standards like the
  <a href="https://www.openboardformat.org">Open Board Format</a>
  so your clients aren't getting locked in to a single vendor.

<h3>For Purchasing Decision-Makers</h3>
<img src="https://d18vdu4p71yql0.cloudfront.net/libraries/arasaac/administration_1.png" class='participate_pic'/>
<p style='margin-top: -15px;'>Make Open Access a requirement for your purchasing decisions. Tell
  vendors that you aren't interested in being locked into a single 
  product forever, tell them how you've been burned by that in the
  past. Encourage them to look at the
  <a href="https://www.openboardformat.org">Open Board Format</a>
  and implement it as an export option in their applications.
