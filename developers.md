<h2>Developing AAC Apps</h2>

<p>
  AAC app development is a noble endeavor, and can provide enormous value
  to people who can will from technology supports. It is important, when
  supporting those who use AAC, that you understand the expectations of
  AAC users, and can build something long-term and robust. We want to
  help make that happen!
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in, or planning on, implementing an AAC app,
  we have collected <a href="/considerations">a list of considerations</a>
  that you should factor in to your development plans. 
</p>
<div style='clear: left;'></div>


<h2>Developing Accessible Projects</h2>
<p>
  Accessibility is something we are starting to see baked
  in to more and more projects. If you are developing a 
  web site, a mobile app, or other projects you think
  AAC users might benefit from, think about how you can
  make things accessible. From larger buttons/targets
  to slower timeouts, there are many little things you
  can do to make things easier on people whose hands shake,
  or who take longer to read, or who need frequent breaks.
  Also consider implementing <a href="https://tools.openaac.org">AAC Shim</a>
  to make it easier for AAC users to access your site.

  Additionally, if you are using the cloud at all, 
  <b>please consider the value of publishing a public API</b>.
  Some users are going to need a very simplified version of
  your interface that focuses only on the primary tasks.
  If you don't have the resources to write and maintain such
  an interface yourself, publishing an API will allow
  AAC vendors and even families to develop their own 
  simplified interfaces to provide access to valuable,
  engaging activites and social interactions that are only
  available via the Internet.

<h2>Accessibility-Focused Projects</h2>
<p>
  It's great to see progress in making technology accesssible,
  from web standards to gaming hardware, there is a lot of
  exciting work happening! The open source community and
  even some vendors are starting to open up and share
  resources so everyone can benefit.
